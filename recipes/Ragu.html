    <h4>Our finest beef ragu for a true taste of Italy at home!</h4>
        <p>An authetic take of making a rich ragu in line with classic the Italian version but easy to make anywhere.</p>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
       
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Oil</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>10ml tomaste puree</li>
            <li>1l beef Stock</li>
            <li>200 ml milk</li>
            <li>1/2 bulb garlic</li>
            <li>500g beef mince</li>
            <li>Mixed Herbs</li>
            <li>Bay Leaves</li>
            <li>100g Parmesan</li>
            <li>YOur preferred amount of pasta, we recommend Parpadelle</li>
            <li>Celery, Carrots, and Onion to make your sufrito</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix your carrots, cleery, and onion together in a blender to make your sufrito base.</li>
            <li>Next, fry this on a low heat in a heavy based pan while making your mince into balls.</li>
            <li>When the moisture is gone from the sufrito and it begins to stick to the pan, add your beef balls. Ensure they fry on the outside and you gently squeeze them down to release the juices.</li>
            <li>When ready, begin pressing the beef down firmly and add garlic. Make sure the beef and vegetable mixture becomes like a paste</li>
            <li>Then, add your tomato puree and ensure this turns a dark red as you gently mix it in.</li>
            <li>You're now ready to slowly add your stock while continually pressing down on the beef mixture.</li>
            <li>Once the stock is added, bring it to a simmer and add your milk. This part of the process will take at least 3.5 hours for it to be ready.</li>
            <li>During this time, add your herbs and bay leaves.</li>
            <li>The mixture should be reduced to a nice, thick consistency and grate in your parmesan</li>
            <li>Simply cook your pasta separately until it is al dente, then turn it in your mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir it together add pull the pasta onto your plate with tongs, catching as much of the ragu mixture as you want, and enjoy!</li>
