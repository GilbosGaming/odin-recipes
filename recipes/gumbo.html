    <h4>A scrumptious Cajun dish ideal as a heartwarming addition to a cold Winter's day</h4>
        <p>made with a dark brown roux base, equal parts fat and flour <br> The dish itself will always contain the Cajun 'Trinity' but can have varied meats and seafood suited to your own taste within.</p>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>The Trinity: Celery</li>
            <li>Bell Peppers</li>
            <li>Onion - all chopped and ready to go!</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Oil</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>1l Chicken Stock</li>
            <li>1/2 bulb garlic</li>
            <li>Jalapenos to taste</li>
            <li>Mixed Herbs</li>
            <li>Bay Leaves</li>
            <li>Your choice of meat and seafood! Though Andouille sausage is often recommended</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>How to Make - Step 1: <br> Start by ensuring your vegetables are chopped, stock is made and everything is ready to go! Then get your oil nice and hot in a ceramic pot, ensure it's smoking before adding your flour. <br> Once the flour is added, stir with a whisk and DO NOT walk away from the pot until the roux is a deep brown colour. Be careful not tot burn at this stage.</li>
            <li>Step 2: <br> Once the roux is done, pour the chopped vegetables straight in to get your Cajun trinity ready. Continue until the sizzling begins to die down (optional: Add a small amount of beer here to further improve your roux, just make sure you cook off any and all alcohol before continuing!).</li>
            <li> Step 3: Once your thick roux mixture has calmed, add the garlic and ensure this cooks over the next minute, before slowly adding your chicken stock. Ensure you incorporate all the roux into the stock as you go.</li>
            <li>Now, we're going to let the mixture continue on a nice simmer for at least 3 hours. As this is being done chop your smoked sausage and cook any other meats to your liking. I recommend lightly sauteeing shrimp in butter or searing split chicken thighs in oil for 7 minutes each side.</li>
            <li>Once all your meats are added, ensure the mixture cooks the full time to get nice and thick. You'll want your herbs and bay leaves added just after your meats are too. Then, serve with your choice of side (usually white rice), and enjoy!</li>
